abstract = {Extraction of three-dimensional structure of a scene from stereo images is a problem that has been studied by the computer vision community for decades. Early work focused on the fundamentals of image correspondence and stereo geometry. Stereo research has matured significantly throughout the years and many advances in computational stereo continue to be made, allowing stereo to be applied to new and more demanding problems. We review recent advances in computational stereo, focusing primarily on three important topics: correspondence methods, methods for occlusion, and real-time implementations. Throughout, we present tables that summarize and draw distinctions among key ideas and approaches. Where available, we provide comparative analyses and we make suggestions for analyses yet to be done.},

abstract = {Stereo correspondence methods rely on matching costs for computing the similarity of image locations. In this pa- per we evaluate the insensitivity of different matching costs with respect to radiometric variations of the input images. We consider both pixel-based and window-based variants and measure their performance in the presence of global intensity changes (e.g., due to gain and exposure differ- ences), local intensity changes (e.g., due to vignetting, non- Lambertian surfaces, and varying lighting), and noise. Us- ing existing stereo datasets with ground-truth disparities as well as six new datasets taken under controlled changes of exposure and lighting, we evaluate the different costs with a local, a semi-global, and a global stereo method. 1.},

@article{Calonder2010,
abstract = {We propose to use binary strings as an efficient feature point descriptor, which we call BRIEF.We show that it is highly discriminative even when using relatively few bits and can be computed using simple intensity difference tests. Furthermore, the descriptor similarity can be evaluated using the Hamming distance, which is very efficient to com- pute, instead of the L2 norm as is usually done. As a result, BRIEF is very fast both to build and to match.We compare it against SURF and U-SURF on standard benchmarks and show that it yields a similar or better recognition performance, while running in a fraction of the time required by either.},

@article{Viola1997,
abstract = {A new information-theoretic approach is presented for finding the pose of an object in an image. The technique does not require information about the surface properties of the object, besides its shape, and is robust with respect to variations of illumination. In our derivation few assumptions are made about the nature of the imaging process. As a result the algorithms are quite general and may foreseeably be used in a wide variety of imaging situations. Experiments are presented that demonstrate the approach registering magnetic resonance (MR) images, aligning a complex 3D object model to real scenes including clutter and occlu-sion, tracking a human head in a video sequence and aligning a view-based 2D object model to real images. The method is based on a formulation of the mutual information between the model and the image. As applied here the technique is intensity-based, rather than feature-based. It works well in domains where edge or gradient-magnitude based methods have difficulty, yet it is more robust than traditional correlation. Additionally, it has an efficient implementation that is based on stochastic approximation.},
